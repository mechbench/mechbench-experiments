"""Smoke test for the L0 canonical hook-aware forward pass.

Acceptance criterion: Model.run produces the expected top-1 next-token on
each FACTUAL_15-style prompt. These prompts are chosen because Gemma 4 E4B
answers them with high confidence, so any change in the framework that
broke the forward path would manifest as wrong tokens here.

This used to also do a numerical comparison against the prototype
forward.py at the project root. forward.py has been deleted now that the
framework is the canonical forward path; the semantic top-1 check is the
sole signal here.

Run from project root with the venv active:
    python -m gemma4_mlx_interp._smoke
