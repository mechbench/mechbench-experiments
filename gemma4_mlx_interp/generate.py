"""Text generation on top of Model.run.

mlx_vlm's bundled generate function is broken for Gemma 4 (produces
repeated-token output, see README of this repo). We do our own naive
autoregressive loop on top of Model.run. It is slow (no KV cache — each
step is a full forward pass) but correct, and it is the only generator
we need for the corpus-generation workflow. Opitmising for throughput
is future work if generation becomes a bottleneck.

Usage:
    from gemma4_mlx_interp import Model, generate_text

    model = Model.load()
    story = generate_text(
        model,
        "Write a one-paragraph story where a character experiences calm. "
        "Only write the story itself, no introduction. Story:",
        max_tokens=180, temperature=0.9, top_p=0.95, seed=42,
    )
    print(story)

For building labeled corpora across many concepts/topics, see
generate_labeled_corpus.

    paper, simplified: instead of 100 topics x 12 stories per concept, let
    the caller pick a tractable scale.

    Each story is elicited with a meta-prompt like:

         no introduction. Story:"

    tokenizer decoding). Some outputs will contain preambles like "Here's
    a story:" — for tiny-scale experiments the caller can filter those;
    for larger scales, the noise averages out in the difference-of-means
    centroid anyway.

    Args:

        concept: The concept name ('calm', 'happy', etc.) for the prompt.
