"""Fact-vector extraction + geometric analyses.

Three layers of functionality:

1. Extraction: fact_vectors / fact_vectors_at run prompts through the model
   and pull the residual stream at chosen positions and layers.

2. Decoding: centroid_decode projects the (mean-subtracted) centroid of a
   group of vectors through the model's tied unembed to read off the

3. Pure-numpy stats: cosine_matrix, cluster_purity, silhouette_cosine,
