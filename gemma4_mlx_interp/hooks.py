"""Hook-point types and name parsing.

A hook point is a named moment in the model's forward pass at which the
framework will (a) invoke any user-supplied callback and (b) optionally
record the activation into the result's cache. This module defines the
callback contract and the name-validation logic; the actual dispatch lives
in _forward.py.

The callback contract is intentionally TransformerLens-style: a function
taking (activation, info) that may return either None (leave unchanged) or
a replacement tensor. Returning a new tensor is how the user modifies
forward-pass behavior — e.g. zeroing it out for ablations, swapping in a
clean activation for causal tracing.
