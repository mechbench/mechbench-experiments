"""OV-circuit activation trajectories: what each head writes, per position.

Complement to step_26's static weight-level analysis. That found that
specific heads have clean multilingual concept structure in their OV
circuit singular components (L5 h3 rank-1 writes 'nation' across
languages, L23 h7 rank-1 writes 'movement', L40 h6 rank-4 writes
'created'). But those are POTENTIAL patterns under SVD decomposition.
This experiment measures what each head is ACTUALLY writing at each
position during a live forward pass.

Two views per (prompt, layer, head):

  POTENTIAL writes (head_ov_position_writes):
    For each position p, what tokens would this head write if it
    attended fully to position p? Uses V[p] projected through W_O and
    then through the tied unembed. Independent of the actual attention
    pattern.

  ACTUAL writes (head_ov_actual_writes):
    For each query position q, what tokens is this head actually
    writing at q given its attention pattern? Uses per_head_out (the
    weighted softmax(QK) @ V).

The difference between POTENTIAL and ACTUAL reveals how the head's
attention pattern shapes its output. A head whose potential writes are
clean but actual writes are messy is 'capable but quiet'. A head whose
potential writes are messy but actual writes are clean is 'the
attention is doing the interpretation.'
