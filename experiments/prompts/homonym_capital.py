"""Homonym-sense prompt sets for the word 'capital'.

Four cohorts of 8 prompts each, each using 'capital' in a distinct sense:

  HOMONYM_CAPITAL_CITY        : 'the capital of France', 'Tokyo became the capital of Japan'
  HOMONYM_CAPITAL_FINANCE     : 'raised capital from investors', 'capital reserves'
  HOMONYM_CAPITAL_UPPERCASE   : 'write in capital letters', 'starts with a capital letter'
  HOMONYM_CAPITAL_PUNISHMENT  : 'capital offense', 'capital punishment'
  HOMONYM_CAPITAL_ALL         : all 32 in one set

Each cohort varies its sentence templates internally so that template
structure isn't systematically different between cohorts (which would
confound a sense-vs-template comparison).

Each prompt has subject='capital'; fact_vectors_at(..., position='subject')
will resolve to the LAST 'capital'-containing token in each prompt. None
of these prompts contain longer words like 'capitalism' or 'capitulation',
so the substring match is unambiguous.
