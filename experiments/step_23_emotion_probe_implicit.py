"""Concept generalization test: score implicit-emotion scenarios.

The self-consistency test in step_21 showed each emotion's training
passages score highest on their own probe — but that is the trivial
thing probes should do. The real test is whether the probes have
learned the EMOTION CONCEPT or merely the TRAINING CORPUS TEMPLATE.

Mirror of Anthropic's Table 2 (Sofroniew et al., Emotion Concepts, 2026):
12 user-turn scenarios, 2 per emotion, that each evoke one of our six
emotions without naming it. If the probes score these scenarios along
the right diagonal, they generalize across surface forms and the
concept claim survives.
