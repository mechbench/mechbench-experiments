"""Big sweep: 12 categories × 8 prompts, with statistical baselines.

Scales finding 10-11 from 5 categories / 40 prompts to 12 categories / ~96
prompts, including diverse relational frames: factual recall, morphology,
translation, professions, arithmetic, animal homes, color mixing.

Also adds a random-subset baseline: compute centroids of random 8-prompt
subsets (ignoring category labels) and project through the unembed. If
random centroids also decode to multilingual concept words, the effect
isn't signal. If they decode to noise/gibberish, our category centroids
carry genuine semantic structure.

Core outputs:
  - per-category centroid decoding at layer 30 (raw and mean-subtracted)
  - random-subset centroid decoding for comparison
  - k-means purity, silhouette, cross-category cosine stats
  - PCA projection colored by category

Run from project root:
