# Gemma 4 global-attention spacing: 5:1 in the family, 4:1 only for E2B

The motivation for this writeup, from task [000125](https://github.com/mechbench/mechbench/blob/main/tasks/mechbench-core/done/000125-investigate-gemma-4-global-attention-spacing-rule-e4b-every.md): both Gemma 4 E4B and E2B have exactly 7 global-attention layers with the *last* layer always global, but the spacing between globals differs (E4B every 6th, E2B every 5th). Several hypotheses to disambiguate — depth-fraction of the pivot, count of KV-shared trailing layers, count of fresh-K/V globals, depth-band targeting, fixed compute budget. Web research closes the question by adding two more datapoints.

## What the configs say

| model | n_layers | global indices | period (local:global) | num_kv_shared_layers | source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Gemma 3 1B | 26 | every 6th (`sliding_window_pattern: 6`) | 5:1 | n/a | [config](https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/gemma-3-1b-it-bf16/raw/main/config.json) |
| Gemma 3 4B | 34 | 5:1 | 5:1 | n/a | [config](https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/gemma-3-4b-it-bf16/raw/main/config.json) |
| Gemma 3 12B | 48 | 5:1 | 5:1 | n/a | [config](https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/gemma-3-12b-it-bf16/raw/main/config.json) |
| Gemma 3 27B | 62 | 5:1 | 5:1 | n/a | [config](https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/gemma-3-27b-it-bf16/raw/main/config.json) |
| **Gemma 4 E2B** | 35 | [4, 9, 14, 19, 24, 29, 34] | **4:1** | **20** | [config](https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/gemma-4-E2B-it-bf16/raw/main/config.json) |
| **Gemma 4 E4B** | 42 | [5, 11, 17, 23, 29, 35, 41] | 5:1 | 18 | [config](https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/gemma-4-E4B-it-bf16/raw/main/config.json) |
| Gemma 4 26B-A4B (MoE) | 30 | [5, 11, 17, 23, 29] | 5:1 | 0 | [config](https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/gemma-4-26B-A4B-it-bf16/raw/main/config.json) |
| Gemma 4 31B (dense) | 60 | [5, 11, 17, …, 59] (10 globals) | 5:1 | 0 | [config](https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/gemma-4-31B-it-bf16/raw/main/config.json) |

(Two corrections to the working notes that motivated this task: E2B has `num_kv_shared_layers = 20`, not 21; and E2B's spacing is best read as period-5 / 4:1 ratio, not "every 5th".)

## Addendum (2026-04-25): "last layer is global" is Gemma-4-only

The 000189 follow-up against Gemma 3 4B confirmed the layer indices observed in the config but flagged a corner case: **Gemma 3 4B's last layer (33) is sliding, not global**. Globals are at [5, 11, 17, 23, 29] — every 6th layer matches the 5:1 ratio, but the rule terminates at L29 rather than the final layer. So:

- "Last layer is global" appears to be a **Gemma 4** rule, observable in every Gemma 4 variant (E2B, E4B, 26B-A4B, 31B).
- Gemma 3 doesn't follow it. Gemma 3 1B/4B/12B/27B all let their final layer be sliding when the modular `i % 6 == 5` pattern doesn't land on it.

This is the kind of detail that's visible in the config artifacts but absent from primary Google sources — same observability problem that motivates this whole document.

The downstream implication for the L23-pivot story: the "last layer is global" rule is *part of* the Gemma 4 architectural-pivot story (the final fresh-K/V global, the closing-act of the network), and **its absence in Gemma 3 weakens the case that the pivot is just an architectural-spacing artifact**. If Gemma 3 4B has no L23-style pivot — and 000189 confirms it does not — the pivot may genuinely be a Gemma-4-E-series feature, downstream of *both* the KV-boundary and the closing-global rules together.

## What the docs say

The Gemma **3** tech report ([arxiv 2503.19786](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19786v1) §2.2) names the design choice and motivates it:

> The architecture was changed to reduce the KV-cache memory that tends to explode with long context by increasing the ratio of local to global attention layers, and keeping the span on local attention short.

…with empirical finding that perplexity is robust to that change, and standard sliding-window of 1024 tokens. So the **5:1 ratio is a Gemma-3-era decision driven by long-context KV memory**, kept across the family.

The Gemma **4** technical material is thinner. The HF blog and the Google Developers blog cover Gemma 4 broadly but don't spell out the spacing rule per-variant; the `layer_types` arrays in the configs are the authoritative artifact. The widely-cited [Maarten Grootendorst visual guide](https://newsletter.maartengrootendorst.com/p/a-visual-guide-to-gemma-4) summarizes the *observable* rule:

> The 4:1 pattern, however, is only for the E2B as all other variants have a 5:1 pattern… Global attention is always the last layer.

I did not find a *primary Google source* stating the "E2B is 4:1, everyone else is 5:1" rule or the "last layer is always global" rule. Both are visible in the HF configs but unattributed in the Gemma 4 papers / blogs I could locate.

## Disambiguating the hypotheses

Re-evaluating the original five with the larger sample:

| hypothesis | verdict |
|---|---|
| (a) Fixed *fraction* of depth at the L23-equivalent pivot | **Ruled out.** E4B 23/42 ≈ 0.55, E2B 14/35 = 0.40, Gemma 3 27B's analogous "second-to-last fresh global" ≈ 41/62 ≈ 0.66. No fixed fraction. |
| (b) Fixed count of KV-shared trailing layers | **Ruled out.** E4B 18, E2B 20, 26B-A4B 0, 31B 0. KV-shared-layers is an on-device-only feature of the E-series. |
| (c) Fixed count of fresh-K/V globals | **Ruled out.** E4B has 4 fresh-K/V globals, E2B has 3 (globals 4,9,14 are upstream of `first_kv_shared = 15`). |
| (d) Spacing tuned for a depth band | **Ruled out.** No band the data fits; the pivot depth varies with size, not period. |
| (e) Spacing chosen for a compute budget | **Closest, but reframed.** What the data actually supports: a *fixed period in local layers per global* (5:1 across the family for KV-cache reasons, deliberately tightened to 4:1 only on the smallest-on-device variant E2B), with the last layer pinned global as a separate stylistic choice. |

The right summary is therefore not "different spacing rules for E4B vs E2B" but: **Gemma 3 picked 5:1 for KV-cache reasons; Gemma 4 inherited that everywhere except E2B, where 4:1 must trade some local-layer count for either better long-range modeling or cleaner KV reuse on the smallest model**. The "every 6th" / "every 5th" framing is downstream of period 6 vs period 5.

## What this means for the L23-pivot story

We previously claimed the architectural pivot at L23 in E4B "generalizes across the family" because the analogous layer in E2B (L14) showed the same convergence. With the wider config table:

- ~~The pivot lands consistently at **2 globals before the end** in the E-series: E4B [5,11,17,23,29,35,41] — pivot at 23 = position 4 of 7; E2B [4,9,14,19,24,29,34] — pivot at 14 = position 3 of 7. The cleanest invariant we have is "the global immediately upstream of the first KV-shared region".~~ **Refuted by 000188 — see below.**
- The 26B-A4B and 31B variants have `num_kv_shared_layers = 0`, so the KV-boundary candidate doesn't even define a pivot for them; whether they exhibit a pivot phenomenon at all remains untested (blocked on `mechbench-remote` for memory reasons).

## Update (2026-04-25 — task 000188 refuted the KV-boundary candidate)

I ran the predictive battery on E2B (steps 02, 04, 30/31, 33) — full writeup at [`step_37_dla_factual_sweep_e2b.md`](step_37_dla_factual_sweep_e2b.md). The framing's specific claim ("L14 is E2B's pivot, mirroring E4B's L23") **fails**:

- **step_02** (layer ablation): peak L6, L9 outranks L14 — opposite of null prediction.
- **step_04** (sublayer ablation): L14 is the most attention-critical non-trivial layer, but L12-13 are nearly tied; null L9 unremarkable as predicted. Partial.
- **step_30/31** (perplexity probe): R² peaks at L12, rotation at L13→L14. Partial — rotation aligned, magnitude not.
- **step_33** (DLA factual sweep): commits cluster at L20-27 (median L23), 0/15 at the predicted L15. Decisive fail.

**What survives:** the *group-level* distinction between fresh-K/V globals (heavy: 5× more layer-ablation damage than KV-shared globals; carry the attention-critical work) and KV-shared globals (light: near-invisible to attention ablation). The *per-layer* "specific global is the pivot" claim does not.

**A new candidate that emerged from the data:** the commit median in E2B is L23 (=23/35 ≈ 0.66 of depth) and in E4B is L25 (=25/42 ≈ 0.60 of depth). Comparable fractions. The pivot may be a **fixed depth-fraction** thing rather than an architectural-spacing thing — which would make it a model-scale property, not a Gemma-4-E-series feature. Filed as a candidate for the next round of work.

Both candidates that came out of 000125 (last-layer-global rule and KV-boundary rule) have now been examined. The first is real but Gemma-4-only (000189 confirmed via Gemma 3 4B). The second was a tempting post-hoc reading that didn't survive predictive testing on E2B itself. The L23-essay's "the model does its real work at L23" claim still stands, but the architectural *explanation* of why is open again.

## Update (2026-04-25 — task 000190 closes the depth-fraction reading too)

After 000188 demoted the KV-boundary candidate, the data left behind a depth-fraction candidate: across both Gemma 4 sizes, the median commit layer in step_33 lands at ~0.66 of network depth (E4B 0.690, E2B 0.657 — Δ 0.033). If real, this would predict the L23-style commit phenomenon in any sufficiently-deep transformer regardless of architectural mechanism.

Task 000190 ran the prediction against Gemma 3 4B (now testable through the proper mechbench-core hook system after 000192 landed). **The depth-fraction candidate also fails** — Gemma 3 4B's median commit fraction is **0.088**, with a bimodal distribution (7 of 15 prompts commit at L0, one outlier at L33). Categorically different from the E-series 0.66 cluster — not a shifted version, a structurally different distribution.

Both candidate generalizations are now refuted predictively:

| candidate | tested | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| Pivot = global immediately upstream of `first_kv_shared` | 000188 | rejected on E2B step_02 / step_33 |
| Depth-fraction commit at ~0.66 of network depth | 000190 | rejected on Gemma 3 4B (median 0.088) |

What's left intact is the **group-level** distinction (fresh-K/V globals do 5× more attention-critical work than KV-shared globals in E2B step_02/step_36) and the **family-specific** L23 phenomenon in Gemma 4 E itself (six confirming angles in E4B; one confirming and three partial-or-failing in E2B; cleanly absent in Gemma 3 4B).

The narrative that fits all the current data: the L23-style pivot is **a feature of the fresh-K/V → KV-shared transition specifically**, not a feature of the boundary global, not a feature of fixed depth-fraction, and not a feature of Gemma-style transformers in general. Models that lack the transition (Gemma 3 family, Qwen 2.5 family — the latter to be confirmed via 000201) shouldn't show it; models that have the transition might or might not, depending on whether the architectural-pressure-concentration story scales (the open question for non-E-series Gemma 4, blocked on remote compute via 000194).

See [`step_38_dla_factual_sweep_gemma3_4b.md`](step_38_dla_factual_sweep_gemma3_4b.md) for the full 000190 writeup.

## Update (2026-04-25 — first non-Gemma datapoint via Qwen 2.5)

Task 000201 unblocked the cross-family question by adding mlx-lm-fallback support to mechbench-core. Step_39 ran the layer-ablation battery on Qwen 2.5 3B Instruct (the first non-Gemma model in the L23-pivot test series): 36 layers, every layer global attention (no hybrid pattern), no KV-sharing, no MatFormer, biased Q/K/V projections. 14/15 FACTUAL_15 prompts validated through the chat template.

**Result: no L23-style pivot.** Top-5 by mean Δ log p: L0 (−15.56), L1 (−13.65), L22 (−2.18), L13 (−1.66), L31 (−1.15). Front-loaded with scattered mid-to-late activity but no concentrated peak. Closest in shape to E2B (front-loaded + weak mid-network distribution); structurally different from E4B (invisible-middle band L10-24 + L23 pivot).

The fourth predictive test of the L23 generalization, the third negative result. The summary table now reads:

| target | what was tested | result | tells us |
|---|---|---|---|
| 000188 (E2B) | KV-boundary specific-pivot framing | failed | pivot isn't *the boundary global* |
| 000189 (Gemma 3 4B) | does pivot exist in non-E-series Gemma | no pivot | pivot isn't a generic Gemma feature |
| 000190 (Gemma 3 4B) | depth-fraction framing (median ≈ 0.66) | failed (G3-4B median 0.088) | pivot isn't a depth-fraction artifact |
| **000201 follow-up (Qwen 2.5 3B)** | does pivot exist in non-Gemma family | **no pivot** | **pivot isn't a generic small-transformer feature** |

What survives all four tests: the L23 phenomenon is **specific to E-series Gemma 4** (or at minimum, to architectures with the fresh-K/V → KV-shared transition). What still needs testing to actually validate the surviving narrative: a non-Gemma-4-E model that *does* have the KV-sharing transition. There aren't any in mlx-lm or mlx-vlm that fit on this hardware; finding or building one is its own task.

Three things this Qwen result decisively rules out:

- The L23 pivot as a generic property of small-to-medium dense transformers (Qwen 2.5 3B and Gemma 3 4B both negative).
- The L23 pivot as a chat-tuning / alignment artifact (all four tested models are instruct-tuned; only one shows it).
- The L23 pivot as anything observable at the 3-4B scale class without the KV-sharing mechanism (three tests, three negatives).

See [`step_39_layer_ablation_qwen2_5_3b.md`](../findings/step_39_layer_ablation_qwen2_5_3b.md) for the full writeup, including the methodology note on why two earlier passes (base + chat template, base + bare prompt) failed before the Instruct + chat-template path validated 14/15.

## Update (2026-04-25 — Qwen 2.5 trio: 000204/205/206 land + 000190 needs revising)

After step_39 landed, I ran the three other cross-family experiments on Qwen 2.5 3B Instruct (DLA factual sweep, sublayer ablation, perplexity probe — steps 40, 41, 42). Two findings revise the surviving narrative; one tightens it.

**Commit-fraction reframe (000190 needs to be revisited).** Step_40's median commit fraction on Qwen 2.5 3B Instruct is **0.750**, close to the E-series cluster (E4B 0.690, E2B 0.657). The picture is now:

| model | median commit frac | shape |
|---|---|---|
| E4B | 0.690 | tight cluster |
| E2B | 0.657 | cluster + 2 outliers |
| **Qwen 2.5 3B Instruct** | **0.750** | **cluster L20-L32 + 3 L0 outliers** |
| Gemma 3 4B | 0.088 | bimodal: 7 L0 + 1 L33 |

Three of four models cluster at depth-fraction ~0.7. **Gemma 3 4B is the outlier, not Qwen.** Task 000190's "depth-fraction candidate refuted" verdict was based on n=1 (Gemma 3 4B's anomalous bimodal distribution) and shouldn't have been generalized. A more careful version of the candidate, given the new data: *"most transformers commit at depth-fraction ~0.7 on FACTUAL_15-style prompts, but a subset of small heavily-Instruct-tuned models route the answer through embed-aligned representations and commit at L0 instead."* That's a hypothesis worth testing on more models, not a finding. See [`step_40_dla_factual_sweep_qwen2_5_3b.md`](../findings/step_40_dla_factual_sweep_qwen2_5_3b.md) for the full re-analysis.

**Sublayer ablation cross-family pattern (000205 result).** Step_41's attn-vs-MLP decomposition on Qwen 2.5 3B Instruct shows distributed attn-criticality (top-5: L24, L27, L14, L31, L21 after the L0/L1 baseline) — *not* the single-isolated-attn-peak that defines E4B's L23. The "MLPs dominate" half of the step_04 finding reproduces; the "only L23 is attn-critical" half does not. Cross-family confirms that the single-attn-critical-layer pattern is Gemma-4-E-specific. See [`step_41_sublayer_ablation_qwen2_5_3b.md`](../findings/step_41_sublayer_ablation_qwen2_5_3b.md).

**Lyra rotation (the surviving-narrative anchor) cross-family verdict (000206 result).** Step_42's perplexity probe on Qwen 2.5 3B Instruct shows two clean signals:

1. **R² shape transfers.** Qwen R² curve rises smoothly from 0.44 at L0 to 0.674 at L24 (depth-fraction 0.667), then declines smoothly to 0.45 at L35. Same general shape as E4B/E2B; peak magnitude similar to E4B's.

2. **The orthogonal-rotation signature does NOT transfer.** Sharpest consecutive cosine drop is L8→L9 = 0.730. Compare to E4B's L22→L23 = 0.033 (essentially orthogonal) and E2B's L13→L14 = 0.015. **Qwen has no layer boundary where the surprise direction rotates dramatically.**

The mechanistic story for E4B's rotation was that the residual basis has to reset at the fresh-K/V → KV-shared transition because downstream KV-shared layers can't freshly read the keys. Qwen has no such transition, so the prediction was: *no equivalent rotation in Qwen*. That's exactly what step_42 shows. The absence of rotation **tightens the surviving narrative**: rotation is fresh-K/V → KV-shared transition specific.

See [`step_42_perplexity_probe_qwen2_5_3b.md`](../findings/step_42_perplexity_probe_qwen2_5_3b.md) for the full writeup including the suggested next experiment (run step_42-equivalent on Gemma 3 4B Instruct to disambiguate "fresh-K/V → KV-shared specific" from "Gemma family specific").

## Where the L23 narrative stands now

After steps 35/36/37 (E2B), step_38 (Gemma 3 4B DLA), step_39/40/41/42 (Qwen 2.5 3B Instruct full quadruple), the picture has shifted but not collapsed:

- **L23-pivot story core (E4B-only six-angle convergence):** unchanged.
- **KV-boundary specific-layer framing:** rejected (000188).
- **Depth-fraction at ~0.7 framing:** **partially recovered** — 3 of 4 models cluster there, Gemma 3 4B is an outlier needing a separate explanation (not a refutation of the framing).
- **Lyra rotation as fresh-K/V → KV-shared specific:** **strengthened** by Qwen's clean negative.
- **Single-attn-critical-layer pattern:** Gemma-4-E-specific (Qwen distributed, E2B partial-band).
- **What's needed:** a model that *has* the KV-sharing transition but isn't Gemma 4 E (none currently fit on this hardware).

Two of three cross-family results in this update tighten the surviving narrative; one (commit-fraction) loosens the 000190 conclusion.
