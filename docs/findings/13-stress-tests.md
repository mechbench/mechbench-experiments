# Stress Tests: Template, Cross-Lingual, and Creative Prompts

**Date:** 2026-04-15
**Script:** `experiments/stress_tests.py`
**Plot:** `caches/stress_tests.png`

## Setup

Three focused probes into the limits of the centroid-decoding technique, all anchored against the 12 big-sweep categories (96 prompts) so we can see exactly *where* each stress-test prompt lands in the existing geometry:

1. **Template variation**: 4 phrasings of "what is the capital of X?" × 4 countries = 16 prompts. Tests whether the representation is operation-semantic or template-syntactic.
2. **Cross-lingual**: Capital prompts in English, French, German, Spanish, Chinese × 4 countries = ~20 prompts. Tests whether the capital-lookup representation is language-invariant.
3. **Creative / open-ended**: 8 subjective or metaphorical prompts with no single correct answer. Tests whether the technique applies beyond structured factual retrieval.

## Result 1: Template sensitivity is semantically meaningful

The representation is **not** template-invariant, but its template sensitivity is structured in a way that makes the technique more interesting, not less.

| Template | Example | % landing in capital cluster | Nearest alternative |
|----------|---------|-----------------------------:|---------------------|
| tmpl1 (original) | "Complete this sentence with one word: The capital of France is" | 4/4 | — |
| tmpl2 (question) | "What is the capital city of France? Answer in one word:" | **0/4** | french (translation) |
| tmpl3 (is-called) | "France's capital city is called, in one word," | 1/4 | author, landmark |
| tmpl4 (paraphrase) | "The administrative center of France is named, in one word," | 4/4 | — (cos 0.91) |

Different phrasings of the same semantic question — "tell me the capital of X" — land in **different regions of the residual stream space**. "Answer in one word:" triggers the **translation/lookup** frame (routes to french cluster). "Is called" triggers the **naming/identification** frame (routes to landmark or author). "Administrative center" is a synonym for capital and routes correctly, but with lower similarity than the canonical phrasing.

This is not a bug — it's a feature. The model's internal representation at subject positions **encodes what kind of operation the prompt is asking for**, and it uses phrasing cues to disambiguate. "What's the capital of France? Answer in one word:" is parsed as "do a lookup/translation" because of the Q&A structure, not as "retrieve capital-of-X fact." The geometry captures this.

For the centroid-decoding technique, this means: the decoded multilingual concept words reflect the *operational frame the model parses*, not just the *content domain*. That's a more precise claim than "the centroid captures the category."

## Result 2: Cross-lingual works for Latin-script languages, fails for Chinese

| Language | Example | % landing in English capital cluster | cos to English capital centroid |
|----------|---------|-------------------------------------:|--------------------------------:|
| English | "The capital of France is" | 4/4 | 0.946 |
| French | "La capitale de la France est" | 4/4 | 0.919 |
| Spanish | "La capital de Francia es" | 4/4 | 0.921 |
| German | "Die Hauptstadt Deutschlands ist" | 1/1* | 0.906 |
| Chinese | "法国的首都是" | **0/4** | 0.834 |

*Only 1 German prompt kept: the tokenizer split "Frankreichs", "Japans", and "Italiens" across subpieces in ways that didn't include the subject word as a single token. This is a limitation of our substring-matching approach, not a fundamental German issue.

**All four Latin-script Indo-European languages cluster tightly with the English capital anchors** (cosine 0.91+). This is a beautiful mirror of the output-side multilingual centroid decoding: the input representation is also language-aligned, at least for languages in similar morphosyntactic and script families.

**Chinese prompts land elsewhere** — nearest anchors are landmark or author, not capital. And the mean-subtracted centroid decoding for Chinese capital prompts decodes to a completely different cluster: `'における'` (Japanese particle), `'版的'` (Chinese: edition), `'传统的'` (Chinese: traditional), `' national'`. Whatever the model is representing at the subject position of a Chinese prompt, it's in a different conceptual neighborhood from the English/French/Spanish/German capital representation.

Possible explanations:
- **Tokenization**: Chinese prompts are much shorter (5 tokens vs 8–10 for the others) and use fundamentally different character-based tokens. The subject position happens to land on 法国 ("France") which is a single compound token rather than a word-level concept.
- **Training data asymmetry**: Gemma 4 may have seen fewer Chinese factual-recall examples with this exact structure, leading to a less-aligned internal representation.
- **Script/family effects**: The model may align Latin-script and Indo-European-syntax representations more tightly than it aligns CJK representations.

This is a specific, falsifiable claim about E4B's multilingual behavior: **cross-lingual factual-recall representations are well-aligned within Latin-script languages but less well-aligned with Chinese**. Testing more languages (Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Hindi, Thai) would tell us where the boundary of this alignment lies.

## Result 3: Creative prompts don't cluster, but centroids still decode meaningfully

Individual creative prompts land in **scattered** regions of the anchor space — different prompts end up near different anchor categories:

| Prompt | Nearest anchor |
|--------|----------------|
| "The best way to spend a Sunday is" | opposite |
| "The most beautiful color is" | french |
| "The perfect meal is" | landmark |
| "A good name for a cat is" | profession |
| "The sound of rain makes me feel" | animal_home |
| "The color of jealousy is" | french |
| "The taste of sadness is" | landmark |
| "The smell of summer is" | color_mix |

No prompt-to-prompt consistency. The technique's clustering power breaks down for open-ended prompts.

**But the centroid decoding still produces coherent concepts!** Even though the individual prompts are scattered, when we average within each creative sub-group and project through the unembed, we get:

- **`creative_meta`** (metaphorical: "sound of rain," "color of jealousy," "taste of sadness," "smell of summer") → mean-subtracted centroid decodes to: `' smelled'`, `' terasa'` (Indonesian "feels"), `' felt'`, `' 느껴'` (Korean "feel"), `' mùi'` (Vietnamese "smell") — **multilingual sensory-perception vocabulary**.
- **`creative_pref`** (preference: "best way to spend Sunday," "most beautiful color," "perfect meal," "good name") → decodes to: `' 반드시'` (Korean "must"), `' richiede'` (Italian "requires"), `' requirement'`, `' requiere'` (Spanish "requires"), `' обязательно'` (Russian "necessarily") — **multilingual requirement/necessity vocabulary**.

The centroid captures the **meta-concept** the individual prompts all share, even when the prompts themselves don't cluster geometrically. This is a stronger methodological result than "technique only works for clean categories": the centroid is robust to the fact that each individual vector might be pulled toward a different anchor by its specific content, because *the anchor pulls cancel out in the average* while the shared meta-concept accumulates.

## Synthesis: refining the claim

The original framing — "the fact vector's centroid decodes to the multilingual relational concept" — needs refinement based on these stress tests:

1. **The technique captures operational frames as parsed by the model, not just semantic categories.** Prompts that ask similar questions but in templates implying different operational frames (Q&A vs completion vs naming) land in different clusters. This is actually a more precise claim: the centroid reflects how the model *parses* the question into a lookup operation, not just what the content domain is.

2. **Language-invariance holds within Latin-script Indo-European languages but breaks for Chinese.** This is a specific, interesting, and testable claim about how Gemma 4 E4B's multilingual representations are aligned. The output-side decoding is fully multilingual (finding 12); the input-side clustering is not, at least between Latin-script and CJK.

3. **The centroid-projection technique is robust to non-clustering inputs.** Even when individual prompts are scattered (open-ended/subjective prompts), the centroid still decodes to a coherent multilingual meta-concept. This means the technique has two distinct use modes:
   - **Clustering mode**: when prompts have a shared relational frame, they cluster AND the centroid decodes meaningfully
   - **Meta-concept mode**: when prompts are varied in surface form but share an abstract frame, they DON'T cluster but the centroid still decodes meaningfully

The second mode is actually more surprising and more methodologically valuable — it means we can extract the "what do these prompts have in common conceptually?" signal even when the prompts themselves are too varied to cluster.

## Implications for writeup

These stress tests are the kind of thing that strengthens rather than weakens a claim, because they're honest about limitations:

- The technique is real (centroid decodes to concept words, randomness baseline has been validated at finding 12).
- It has specific, characterizable sensitivities (to template phrasing, to language family).
- It works in two different modes (with and without clustering) which is interesting rather than problematic.

For a writeup, this means we can make the **strong, nuanced claim**: "centroid decoding at subject positions in middle layers reveals the multilingual relational concept the model parses from the prompt — this works robustly within Latin-script language families, is sensitive to template-implied operational frames in interesting ways, and surprisingly extends to open-ended prompts via a meta-concept mechanism."

That's a more interesting thing to report than "it just works."
